        <h5>Overview</h5>
        Java is a high-level, versatile programming language renowned for its portability, security, and robustness. Developed by Sun Microsystems (acquired by Oracle Corporation), Java has become one of the most popular languages in the software development industry. Its widespread adoption can be attributed to its platform independence, object-oriented nature, rich standard library, and active community support. Below is an overview of key concepts and features of Java:
        <br>
        <h5>1. Platform Independence:</h5>
        Java programs are compiled into bytecode, which can run on any platform with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This "write once, run anywhere" capability makes Java highly portable and suitable for developing applications ranging from desktop to mobile and enterprise systems.
        <br>
        <h5>2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</h5>
        Java is fundamentally object-oriented, emphasizing the creation of reusable, modular code. It supports features like classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, enabling developers to build complex systems with clear hierarchies and relationships.
        <br>
        <h5>3. Syntax and Structure:</h5>
        Java syntax is largely influenced by C and C++, making it familiar to programmers from these backgrounds. It employs a structured approach with curly braces for defining blocks of code, semicolons to terminate statements, and a rich set of keywords for control flow, data manipulation, and class/interface definitions.
        <br>
        <h5>4. Standard Library:</h5>
        Java provides a comprehensive standard library, known as the Java API (Application Programming Interface). This library encompasses classes and interfaces for essential functionalities such as file I/O, networking, collections, concurrency, GUI development (Swing, JavaFX), and more. Leveraging the Java API significantly accelerates development by offering pre-implemented solutions to common programming tasks.
        <br>
        <h5>5. Memory Management and Garbage Collection:</h5>
        Java manages memory allocation and deallocation automatically through its garbage collection mechanism. Developers need not explicitly allocate or free memory, reducing the risk of memory leaks and segmentation faults. Garbage collection improves application stability and simplifies memory management.
        <br>
        <h5>6. Concurrency:</h5>
        Java supports concurrent programming through its built-in features like threads and synchronization. Developers can create multithreaded applications to execute tasks concurrently, enhancing performance and responsiveness. Java also offers high-level concurrency utilities like Executor Framework and concurrent data structures for safe shared memory access.
        <br>
        <h5>7. Security:</h5>
        Security is a core aspect of Java's design philosophy. The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) includes security measures such as sandboxing, bytecode verification, and access control to prevent malicious code execution and protect system integrity. Java's security model makes it a preferred choice for developing secure applications, especially in sensitive domains like finance and healthcare.
        <br>
        <h5>8. Community and Ecosystem:</h5>
        Java boasts a vast and active community of developers, contributors, and enthusiasts. Online forums, user groups, and communities provide support, resources, and collaboration opportunities for Java developers worldwide. Additionally, Java's ecosystem is enriched with third-party libraries, frameworks (e.g., Spring, Hibernate), development tools (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse), and build automation tools (e.g., Maven, Gradle), empowering developers to build sophisticated and scalable applications efficiently.</p>
